                The first thing that I tried to do was to reuse some old art I had done for a previous class. I quickly realized that this was not going to be possible and started thinking about alternative ideas, like you know actually doing my work. I remembered a band I liked called, “Delta Sleep”, they always had cool album cover art that I enjoyed so I found one that I particularly liked and traced it with the pen tool.

                I then emailed the necessary files to the computer connected to the vinyl cutter. I encountered my first problem with my drawing because it was very detailed and in many places extremely thin. This ment my cuts would fail unless I made the entire design large enough that the piece could survive. I also found that if I slightly increased the cut pressure the vinyl would catch less on the blade.

                Finally after determining a good size and force level for a successful cut I made my final projects. I put my sticker on one of my longboards and the cloth heat pressed vinyl onto one of my hoodies.
