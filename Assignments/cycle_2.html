                To start off I measured my Apple pen and created a box on Fusion that would let it have a 2 millimeter gap on all sides for the thickness of the walls. I then added an internal box with a triangel at one tip to make a pen shape. I also rounded the outside corners of the extirior box. Finally I used the extruded tool to pull up the walls and pull down the base creating the main body of the container.

                The second step of the project was to create the lid of the container. I did this by going back into the 2D drawing and copying the shapes and extruding the pen shape about 2 millimeters instead of the walls and again pulling down the base to give it some thickness.

                Finally after transferring the files from my computer to the printer I began the printing process. When it was all done I realized that I had been a little off on my measurements and the lid didn't quite fit at the tip of the pen. I fixed the CAD design but decided not to print again. Instead I took a hot glue gun and used the heated part of the glue gun to adjust the lid and container to allow the two parts to fit and protect the Apple Pen.
